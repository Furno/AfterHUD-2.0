# AfterHUD-2.0
A thing.
Hello there! This is a HUD I made from combining 3 Huds made by other people. Please go check the Huds out if you want the originals:

raysHUD: http://gamebanana.com/guis/28016
aHUD:    http://gamebanana.com/guis/30919
KBNHUD:  http://gamebanana.com/guis/27411

NOTE:
I still haven't messed with some of the files (Target ID and MvM related stuff) so expect a new version of this HUD.


ANOTHER NOTE:
Don't share this with anyone please. This HUD was made for personal use only, but since some of my friends wanted it,
I've given this link to them. So if you're a random stranger that happens to find this HUD, Use it if you like, just
don't share it with anyone else.
